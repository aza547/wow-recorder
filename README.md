A desktop screen recorder application that records and saves videos of in-game events, and provides a graphical user interface to view the replays. 

Warcraft Recorder watches the combat log file for events, records to disk and then plays back the recordings in the user interface.

Windows is currently the only supported operating system.

If you are a retail arena player, I also recommend the [jaxSurrender](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/jaxsurrender) addon.

# Testing It Works

You can test that Warcraft Recorder works by clicking the test icon with World of Warcraft running after you have completed the above setup steps. 

This runs a 10 second test of the recording functionality by mimicing a 2v2 game.
