Warcraft Recorder is a desktop application and screen recorder, it watches the WoW combat log file for interesting events, records them, and presents a user interface in which the recordings can be viewed.

Windows is currently the only supported operating system. 

#  How to Use
1. Download and run the most recent installer (e.g WarcraftRecorder.Setup.3.1.2.exe) from the [releases](https://github.com/aza547/wow-recorder/releases) section.
1. Launch the application and fill out the settings page.
1. Enable combat logging.
    - Retail: Install and configure the SimpleCombatLogger addon ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simplecombatlogger), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/simplecombatlogger)).
    - Classic: Install and configure the AutoCombatLogger addon ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/autocombatlogger), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/autocombatlogger)). 

If you are a retail arena player, I also recommend the [jaxSurrender](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/jaxsurrender) addon.

# Testing It Works

You can test that Warcraft Recorder works by clicking the test icon with World of Warcraft running after you have completed the above setup steps. This runs a 10 second test of the recording functionality by mimicing a 2v2 game.
